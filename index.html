        <p>Hello, my name is Andrew Crudden. This website was created using GitHub and HTML techniques learned from the course CSC106 at the University of Rhode Island.<br>
            This website was created to show how techniques learned through KhanAcademy and CSC106, can help simplify the idea of making a website.<br>
            Thank you for visiting my website and enjoy!<br>
